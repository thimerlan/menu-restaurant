    description:
      "What Is a Belgian Waffle? Belgian waffles are beloved for their extra-deep pockets—the better for filling with butter, jam, or maple syrup. They are often thicker than their American counterparts, and made with a yeasted batter and crunchy pearl sugar. There's nothing quite like a classic Belgian waffle.",

      "Tiramisu is an elegant and rich layered Italian dessert made with delicate ladyfinger cookies, espresso or instant espresso, mascarpone cheese, eggs, sugar, Marsala wine, rum and cocoa powder. Through the grouping of these diverse ingredients, an intense yet refined dish emerges.",

      "Anyone who has EVER been to Lisbon, Portugal, will know what I mean when I say that Portuguese tarts are some of the best desserts in the world. Best served warm and with a generous sprinkle of cinnamon, I think these might be my all-time favourite sweet snack. This recipe comes incredibly close to the originals on offer at Pastel de Belem just outside of Lisbon.",

      "For those of you who read my blog often, you’ll know that I am certified caramel obsessed. There’s not a day in my life that I would have turned down the offer of anything caramel, butterscotch, or dulce de leche flavoured. For anyone who feels the same, you MUST try this banoffee pie at home. Get ready to unbutton the pants!",

    description:
      "Australia’s classic summertime dessert is as good as it gets in my opinion. Sweet meringue, crispy on the outside, and covered in summer berries. As far as the best desserts in the world go, pavlova ranks high to the top of the list. Aussies love this dessert at Christmas (as we celebrate the holiday season in summer), but I can’t say there has ever been a time of year that I haven’t enjoyed a pavlova!",

    description:
      "This dark and rich cake is a high-wire act of time and temperature: Serve too early and it's a sticky pool of hot cake batter; serve too late and it's a brownie. When the balance is perfect, however, the treat blends the tender bite of a chocolate cake with the oozy pleasure of a melted chocolate bar.",

    description:
      "I just don’t think it would be fair or just to not name gelato as my first choice dessert. Personally, my favourite flavours are caramel (no surprises there), snickers, and dulce de leche (caramel with a thick caramel sauce swirled through). But in an effort of fairness, I’ve offered a blueberry butter cookie gelato as an alternative. I’m sure there won’t be any complaints!",
